This is our Open Android Travel Planner. It is built on the Android 2.2 Platform.

Travel Planner is an android application that helps you to organize your trip. It gives you a checklist which can remind you with a list of necessary things might want to carry with you. It can also be served as a reminder of the warnings or any events that you want to attend at the destination of your travel.
This application can be used by people of all ages, and allows multiple users as a separate checklist can be created by everyone in the family.
The new features added are google maps by which the user can select the location TO and From from google maps rather than typing in the location. The various error handling has also been done in this version.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
-------------------

With limited memory and enormous data our brains need to remember, it helps to have a checklist which can help us plan a better trip. Be it a trip to a grocery store with all the list of items you want to buy or a trip to a location across the borders of the country, it always helps if things are done in an organized manner. It gives you a checklist which can remind you with a list of necessary things might want to carry with you. It can also be served as a reminder of the warnings or any events that you want to attend at the destination of your travel. This application can be used by people of all ages, and allows multiple users as a separate checklist can be created by everyone in the family.

PROJECT MOTIVATION
------------------
This is a modification of my old app and I am trying to reuse my old application and introduce google maps in this application.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
-------------------
 •Presently TravelPlanner is saving all the data that you entered in its database and remembers that for you. Later when you open the checklist it gives that data back to you.
 •Addition of google maps in it so that it also gives you the map. Still addition of feature which can give distance and temperature of the destination needs to be taken care of.
 •In future, we also plan to add a way in which this application can extract the names of the people from the contact list living in that Destination area.
